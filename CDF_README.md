This is done as part of CDF Capstone project.

InsaidTelecom, one of the leading telecom players, understands that customizing offering
is very important for its business to stay competitive.
Currently, InsaidTelecom is seeking to leverage behavioral data from more than 60% of the 50 million mobile devices active daily in India
to help its clients better understand and interact with their audiences.

In this consulting assignment, Insaidians are expected to build a dashboard to understand
user's demographic characteristics based on their mobile usage, geolocation, and mobile device properties.
Doing so will help millions of developers and brand advertisers around the world pursue
data-driven marketing efforts which are relevant to their users and catered to their preferences.
